User choice over Online Behavioural Advertising
A. Each Third Party should make available a mechanism for web users to exercise their choice with respect to the collection and use of data for OBA purposes and the transfer of such data to Third Parties for OBA. Such choice should be available from the notice described in I.A.1 and via the OBA User Choice Site.

Under the EASA/IAB Code, an icon will be used as an information notice for
behavioural advertising. In the current implementation of the Code, the icon is linked to
an information website, www.youronlinechoices.eu. 

Since the icon in itself and the website www.youronlinechoices.eu do not provide
accurate and easily understandable information about the different controllers
(advertising networks) and their purposes for the processing, the Code and the website
do not meet the requirement set out at the revised e-Privacy Directive.""" , """What mechanisms can be used to seek consent?

In practice, via a notification and cookies statement
Currently observed implementations are based on one or more of the following practices, although it is important to note that whilst each may be a useful component of a consent mechanism the use of an individual practice in isolation is unlikely to be sufficient to provide valid consent as all elements of valid consent need to be present (e.g. an effective choice mechanism also requires notice and information): 
•	an immediately visible notice that various types of cookies are being used by the website, providing information in a layered approach, typically providing a link, or series of links, where the user can find out more about types of cookies being used, 
•	an immediately visible notice that by using the website, the user agrees to cookies being set by the websites, 
•	information as to how the users can signify and later withdraw their wishes regarding cookies including information on the action required to express such a preference,  
•	a mechanism by which the user can choose to accept all or some or decline cookies,  
•	an option for the user to subsequently change a prior preference regarding cookies.

The methods for giving information, offering a right to refuse or requesting consent should be made as user-friendly as possible.

A pop up is not the only possible way to receive consent
Many people are led to believe that pop up screens are the only way to obtain consent. This is not the case. There are many examples of other, more user friendly ways, to obtain consent. Some of these examples are:
- A static information banner on top of a website requesting the user’s consent to set some cookies, with a hyperlink to a privacy statement with a more detailed explanation about the different controllers and the purposes of the processing. Such a banner is currently employed by the UK data protection authority8.
- A splash screen on entering the website explaining what cookies will be set by what parties if the user consents. Such splash screens are being used by for example breweries that wish to ensure their visitors are old enough to be allowed to visit the website.


R9: The EU institution must give the users simple tools to easily express and manage (e.g. withdraw) their consent at any moment and for each and every category of cookies, depending on their purpose and origin (first or third party). 

R10: The EU institution should recommend that users read the cookie notice and collect consent in the section of the web service where clear and comprehensive information on cookies is given. 

R11: The EU institution must collect consent as the result of a user’s active behaviour that leaves no room for interpretation of the user’s choice. As a result, an explicit consent to the way cookies are used in the web service is considered as the most appropriate way of expressing consent. Continuing using the web service does not guarantee unambiguous consent. 

R13: The consent management mechanism provided by the EU institution should enable the institution to demonstrate that consent was obtained and how""" ;

First party session cookies are far more likely to be exempted from consent than third party persistent cookies. However, the purpose of the cookie should always be the basis for evaluating if the exemption can be successfully applied rather than a technical feature of the cookie.

This analysis has shown that the following cookies can be exempted from informed consent under certain conditions if they are not used for additional purposes: 
1) User input cookies (session-id), for the duration of a session or persistent cookies limited to a few hours in some cases. 
2) Authentication cookies, used for authenticated services, for the duration of a session. 
3) User centric security cookies, used to detect authentication abuses, for a limited persistent duration. 
4) Multimedia content player session cookies, such as flash player cookies, for the duration of a session. 
5) Load balancing session cookies, for the duration of session. 
6) UI customization persistent cookies, for the duration of a session (or slightly more). 
7) Third party social plug-in content sharing cookies, for logged in members of a social network. 

Having regard to social networks, the working party notes however that the use of third party social plug-in cookies for other purposes than to provide a functionality explicitly requested by their own members requires consent, notably if these purposes involve tracking users across websites. 
The working party recalls that third party advertising cookies cannot be exempted from consent, and further clarifies that consent would also be needed for operational purposes related to third party advertising such as frequency capping, financial logging, ad affiliation, click fraud detection, research and market analysis, product improvement and debugging. While some operational purposes might certainly distinguish one user from another, in principle these purposes do not justify the use of unique identifiers. This point is of particular relevance in the context of the current discussions regarding the implementation of the Do Not Track standard in Europe. 
This analysis also shows that first party analytics cookies are not exempt from consent but pose limited privacy risks, provided reasonable safeguards are in place, including adequate information, the ability to opt-out easily and comprehensive anonymisation mechanisms.""" , """What is applicable in these exceptional cases?

Opt-out = individual right to object
Situations where data controllers use consent as a legal ground to process personal data should not be confused with situations where the controller bases the processing on other legal grounds which entail an individual right to object
Reliance on these two exceptions to the obligation to seek prior consent does not relieve the data controller from complying with the obligation to provide information and to provide a possibility to object.
This analysis is conducted without prejudice to the right to be informed and the eventual right to oppose set forth by Directive 95/46/EC, which apply to personal data processing whether cookies are used or not.""" ;

	rdfs:comment """Does the EASA/IAB Code provide users with consent options compliant with Article 5(3)? 

No.
The EASA/IAB Code, instead of seeking users consent, claims to provide for a way of exercising “choice”. In fact it is a choice to opt out, as it offers the user the possibility to object to having his/her data collected and further processed for OBA.
This \"choice\" is not consistent with Article 5(3) of the revised e-Privacy Directive, as the data are in fact processed without user's consent and without providing the user with information before the processing takes place. Therefore, adherence to Principle II does not meet the requirement set out at the revised e-Privacy Directive. 

- User choice site: www.youronlinechoices.eu
The first practical implementation of the EASA/IAB Code is the www.youronlinechoices.eu website, where the method selected to express “choice” is based on the use of different \"opt-out\" cookies. With the help of such a cookie an advertising network may record the user’s refusal to further take part in online behavioural advertising. This approach could easily be modified to be compliant with the amended Article 5(3) of the directive by creating an “opt-in” cookie solution, as explained later on.
The website contains a list with different names of advertising networks. Users may indicate their preference if they do not wish to receive targeted advertising from one, more or all of the networks. Selecting one or more advertising networks results in the installation of one or more opt-out cookies from these networks. 
This implementation, apart from the fact that it follows an opt-out approach and thus is not consistent with the requirement for prior informed consent as set out in article 5(3) of the revised e-Privacy Directive, has the following additional problems:
a) Although the opt-out cookie prevents the further reception of personalised advertising, it does not stop the advertising network from accessing and storing information in the user's terminal. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated that an ongoing technical exchange of information between the user’s terminal equipment and the advertising network is still in place after the installation of the opt-out cookie.
b) The user is not informed on whether or not the tracking cookie remains stored in his/her computer and for what purpose.
c) The installation of the opt-out cookie does not offer the possibility to manage and delete previously installed tracking cookies, whereas at the same time it creates the mistaken presumption that opting out disables the tracking of internet behaviour.""" , "‘consent’ by a user or subscriber corresponds to the data subject's consent in Directive 95/46/EC" ;

• Article 5(3) applies whenever \"information\" such as a cookie is stored or retrieved from the terminal equipment of an internet user. It is not a prerequisite that this information is personal data.

However:
• Directive 95/46/EC applies to matters not specifically covered by the ePrivacy Directive whenever personal data are processed. Behavioural advertising is based on the use of identifiers that enable the creation of very detailed user's profiles which, in most cases, will be deemed personal data.”

• Network providers should ensure compliance with the obligations that arise from Directive 95/46/EC which do not directly overlap with Article 5(3), namely, the purpose limitation principle, and security obligations. 


Opinion 02/2013 on apps on smart devices
states:
“existence of a “distinction between the consent required to place any information on and read information from the device, and the consent necessary to have a legal ground for the processing of personal data. Though both consent requirements are simultaneously applicable [...] the two types of consent can be merged in practice, provided that the user is made unambiguously aware of what he is consenting to.”

Recital 10 of E-Privacy Directive (2002/58/EC) states:
In the electronic communications sector, Directive 95/46/EC applies in particular to all matters concerning protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, which are not specifically covered by the provisions of this Directive, including the obligations on the controller and the rights of individuals. Directive 95/46/EC applies to non-public communications services.""" .

• Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive which sets up an obligation to obtain prior informed consent applies to ad network providers. 
• Ad network providers should encourage and work with browser manufacturers/developers to implement privacy by design in browsers. 
• Ad network providers should swiftly move away from opt-out mechanisms and create prior opt-in mechanisms. Mechanisms to deliver informed, valid consent should require an affirmative action by the data subject indicating his/her willingness to receive cookies and the subsequent monitoring of their surfing behaviour for the purposes of sending him tailored advertising. 
• In accordance with Recital 25 of the ePrivacy Directive, a users' acceptance to receive a cookie could also entail his/her acceptance for the subsequent readings of the cookie, and hence for the monitoring of his/her internet browsing. It would not be necessary to request consent for each reading of the cookie. However, to ensure that data subjects remain aware of the monitoring over time, ad network providers should: i) limit in time the scope of the consent; ii) offer the possibility to easily revoke their consent to being monitored for the purposes of serving behavioural advertising and iii) create a symbol or other tools which should be visible in all the web sites where the monitoring takes place (the website partners of the ad network provider). This symbol would not only remind individuals of the monitoring but also help them to control whether they want to continue being monitored or wish to revoke their consent. 
• Network providers should ensure compliance with the obligations that arise from Directive 95/46/EC which do not directly overlap with Article 5(3), namely, the purpose limitation principle, and security obligations. 
• In addition, the ad network providers should enable individuals to exercise their rights of access and rectification and erasure. The Article 29 Working Party welcomes the practice of some ad network providers to offer data subjects the possibility to access and modify the interest categories in which they have been classified.  
• Ad network providers should implement retention policies which ensure that information collected each time that a cookie is read is automatically deleted after a justified period of time (necessary for the purposes of the processing). This also applies for alternative tracking technologies used for behavioural advertising such as JavaScript installed in the user's browser environment.""" ;

1) User input cookies (session-id), for the duration of a session or persistent cookies limited to a few hours in some cases. 
2) Authentication cookies, used for authenticated services, for the duration of a session. 
3) User centric security cookies, used to detect authentication abuses, for a limited persistent duration. 
4) Multimedia content player session cookies, such as flash player cookies, for the duration of a session. 
5) Load balancing session cookies, for the duration of session. 
6) UI customization persistent cookies, for the duration of a session (or slightly more). 
7) Third party social plug-in content sharing cookies, for logged in members of a social network. 

Having regard to social networks, the working party notes however that the use of third party social plug-in cookies for other purposes than to provide a functionality explicitly requested by their own members requires consent, notably if these purposes involve tracking users across websites. 
The working party recalls that third party advertising cookies cannot be exempted from consent, and further clarifies that consent would also be needed for operational purposes related to third party advertising such as frequency capping, financial logging, ad affiliation, click fraud detection, research and market analysis, product improvement and debugging. While some operational purposes might certainly distinguish one user from another, in principle these purposes do not justify the use of unique identifiers. This point is of particular relevance in the context of the current discussions regarding the implementation of the Do Not Track standard in Europe. 
This analysis also shows that first party analytics cookies are not exempt from consent but pose limited privacy risks, provided reasonable safeguards are in place, including adequate information, the ability to opt-out easily and comprehensive anonymisation mechanisms. 
Some primary guidelines can be drawn from the analysis and the cookie use scenarios presented in this opinion:  


1) When applying CRITERION B, it is important to examine what is strictly necessary from the point of view of the user, not the service provider. 
2) If a cookie is used for several purposes, it can only benefit from an exemption to informed consent if each distinct purpose individually benefits from such an exemption. 
3) First party session cookies are far more likely to be exempted from consent than third party persistent cookies. However the purpose of the cookie should always be the basis for evaluating if the exemption can be successfully applied rather than a technical feature of the cookie. 

Ultimately, to decide if a cookie is exempt from the principle of informed consent it is important to verify carefully if it fulfils one of the two exemption criteria defined in Article 5.3 as modified by Directive 2009/136/EC. After a careful examination, if substantial doubts remain on whether or not an exemption criterion applies, website operators should closely examine if there is not in practice an opportunity to gain consent from users in a simple unobtrusive way, thus avoiding any legal uncertainty.""" , "Working Party 29 Opinion 04/2012 on Cookie Consent Exemption" .

	rdfs:comment """IV.1. Clarification of the key aspects of the current framework
Article 2 (h) of Directive 95/46/EC defines consent as \"any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed\". Article 7 of the Directive, which sets forth the legal basis for processing personal data, sets out unambiguous consent as one of the legal grounds. Article 8 requires explicit consent as a legal ground to process sensitive data. Article 26.1 of Directive 95/46/EC and various provisions of the ePrivacy Directive require consent to carry out specific data processing activities within their scope of application. The points developed in this opinion aim at clarifying the various elements of this legal framework in an effort to make it easier to apply by stakeholders in general.

Elements/observations of general nature
-	Consent is one of the six legal grounds to process personal data (one of five for sensitive data); it is an important ground as it gives some control to the data subject with regard to the processing of his data. The relevance of consent as an enabler of the individual’s autonomy and self-determination relies on its use in the right context and with the necessary elements.
-	Generally speaking, the legal framework of Directive 95/46/EC applies whenever consent is sought, independently of whether this happens off-line or on-line. For example, the same rules apply when a bricks and mortar retailer seeks sign up for a loyalty card scheme via a paper form, as would be the case if it did this through its Internet site. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive specifies certain data processing operations which are subject to consent: they mostly relate to the processing of data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communication services. The requirements for consent to be valid within Directive 2002/58/EC are the same as under Directive 95/46/EC.
-	Situations where data controllers use consent as a legal ground to process personal data should not be confused with situations where the controller bases the processing on other legal grounds which entail an individual right to object. For example, this may be the case when the processing relies on the 'legitimate interests' of the data controller ex Article 7(f) of Directive 95/46/EC, yet the individual has the right to object ex Article 14(a) of Directive 95/46/EC. Another example is when a data controller sends e-mail communications to existing clients in order to promote the data controller's own or similar products or services, however, individuals have a right to object under Article 13.2 of Directive 2002/58/EC. In both cases, the data subject has the right to object to the processing, this is not the same as consent.
-	Reliance on consent to process personal data does not relieve the data controller from his obligation to meet the other requirements of the data protection legal framework, for example, to comply with the principle of proportionality under Article 6.1(c), security of the processing ex Article 17, etc. 
-	Valid consent presupposes individuals' capacity to consent. Rules regarding the capacity to consent are not harmonised and may therefore vary from Member State to Member State.
-	Individuals who have consented should be able to withdraw their consent, preventing further processing of their data. This is confirmed also under the ePrivacy Directive for specific data processing operations based on consent, such as the processing of location data other than traffic data. 
-	Consent must be provided before the processing of personal data starts, but it can also be required in the course of a processing, where there is a new purpose. This is stressed in various provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC, either through the requirement \"prior\" (e.g. Article 6.3) or through the wording of the provisions (e.g. Article 5.3).

Specific elements of the legal framework related to consent
• For consent to be valid, it must be freely given. This means that there must be no risk of deception, intimidation or significant negative consequences for the data subject if he/she does not consent. Data processing operations in the employment environment where there is an element of subordination, as well as in the context of government services such as health may require careful assessment of whether individuals are free to consent.
• Consent must be specific. Blanket consent without determination of the exact purposes does not meet the threshold. Rather than inserting the information in the general conditions of the contract, this calls for the use of specific consent clauses, separated from the general terms and conditions.
• Consent must be informed. Articles 10 and 11 of the Directive lists the type of information that must necessarily be provided to individuals. In any event, the information provided must be sufficient to guarantee that individuals can make well informed decisions about the processing of their personal data. The need for consent to be \"informed\" translates into two additional requirements. First, the way in which the information is given must ensure the use of appropriate language so that data subjects understand what they are consenting to and for what purposes. This is contextual. The use of overly complicated legal or technical jargon would not meet the requirements of the law. Second, the information provided to users should be clear and sufficiently conspicuous so that users cannot overlook it. The information must be provided directly to individuals. It is not enough for it to be merely available somewhere.
• As to how consent must be provided, Article 8.2(a) requires explicit consent to process sensitive data, meaning an active response, oral or in writing, whereby the individual expresses his/her wish to have his/her data processed for certain purposes. Therefore, express consent cannot be obtained by the presence of a pre-ticked box. The data subject must take some positive action to signify consent and must be free not to consent.
• For data other than sensitive data, Article 7(a) requires consent to be unambiguous. \"Unambiguous\" calls for the use of mechanisms to obtain consent that leave no doubt as to the individual's intention to provide consent. In practical terms, this requirement enables data controllers to use different types of mechanisms to seek consent, ranging from statements to indicate agreement (express consent), to mechanisms that rely on actions that aim at indicating agreement.
• Consent based on an individual's inaction or silence would normally not constitute valid consent, especially in an on-line context. This is an issue that arises in particular with regard to the use of default settings which the data subject is required to modify in order to reject the processing. For example, this is the case with the use of pre-ticked boxes or Internet browser settings that are set by default to collect data.""" ;

	rdfs:comment """Paragraph 6.1 Applicable laws
• Article 5(3) applies whenever \"information\" such as a cookie is stored or retrieved from the terminal equipment of an internet user. It is not a prerequisite that this information is personal data.
• In addition, Directive 95/46/EC applies to matters not specifically covered by the ePrivacy Directive whenever personal data are processed. Behavioural advertising is based on the use of identifiers that enable the creation of very detailed user's profiles which, in most cases, will be deemed personal data.

Paragraph 6.4 Obligations and rights 
Regarding ad network providers: 
• Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive which sets up an obligation to obtain prior informed consent applies to ad network providers. 
• Browser settings may only deliver consent in very limited circumstances. Notably, if browsers are set up by default to reject all cookies (having the browser set to such an option) and the user has changed the settings to affirmatively accept cookies, for which he has been fully informed about the name of the data controller, the processing its goals and the data that is collected. Therefore, the browser must either alone or in combination with other means effectively convey clear, comprehensive and fully visible information about the processing. 
• Ad network providers should encourage and work with browser manufacturers/developers to implement privacy by design in browsers. 
• Cookie-based opt-out mechanisms in general do not constitute an adequate mechanism to obtain informed user consent.  In most cases user's consent is implied if they do not opt out. However, in practice, very few people exercise the opt-out option, not because they have made an informed decision to accept behavioural advertising, but rather because they do not realise that the processing is taking place, much less how to exercise the opt out. 
• Ad network providers should swiftly move away from opt-out mechanisms and create prior opt-in mechanisms. Mechanisms to deliver informed, valid consent should require an affirmative action by the data subject indicating his/her willingness to receive cookies and the subsequent monitoring of their surfing behaviour for the purposes of sending him tailored advertising. 
• In accordance with Recital 25 of the ePrivacy Directive, a users' acceptance to receive a cookie could also entail his/her acceptance for the subsequent readings of the cookie, and hence for the monitoring of his/her internet browsing. It would not be necessary to request consent for each reading of the cookie. However, to ensure that data subjects remain aware of the monitoring over time, ad network providers should: i) limit in time the scope of the consent; ii) offer the possibility to easily revoke their consent to being monitored for the purposes of serving behavioural advertising and iii) create a symbol or other tools which should be visible in all the web sites where the monitoring takes place (the website partners of the ad network provider). This symbol would not only remind individuals of the monitoring but also help them to control whether they want to continue being monitored or wish to revoke their consent. 
• Network providers should ensure compliance with the obligations that arise from Directive 95/46/EC which do not directly overlap with Article 5(3), namely, the purpose limitation principle, and security obligations. 
• In addition, the ad network providers should enable individuals to exercise their rights of access and rectification and erasure. The Article 29 Working Party welcomes the practice of some ad network providers to offer data subjects the possibility to access and modify the interest categories in which they have been classified.  
• Ad network providers should implement retention policies which ensure that information collected each time that a cookie is read is automatically deleted after a justified period of time (necessary for the purposes of the processing). This also applies for alternative tracking technologies used for behavioural advertising such as JavaScript installed in the user's browser environment.  

Ad network providers and publishers: 
• Providing highly visible information is a precondition for consent to be valid. Mentioning the practice of behavioural advertising in general terms and conditions and/or privacy policies can never suffice. In this regard and taking into account the average low level of knowledge about the practice of behavioural advertising, efforts should be applied to change this situation. 
• Ad network providers/ publishers must provide information to users in compliance with Article 10 of Directive 95/46/EC. In practical terms, they should ensure that individuals are told, at a minimum, who (i.e. which entity) is responsible for serving the cookie and collecting the related information. In addition, they should be informed in simple ways that (a) the cookie will be used to create profiles; (b) what type of information will be collected to build such profiles; (c) the fact that the profiles will be used to deliver targeted advertising and (d) the fact that the cookie will enable the user's identification across multiple web sites. 
• Network providers/ publishers should provide the information directly on the screen, interactively, if needed, through layered notices.  In any event it should be easily accessible and highly visible. 
• Icons placed on the publisher's website, around advertising, with links to additional information, are good examples. The Article 29 Working Party urges the network providers/ publisher industry to be creative in this area.""" ;
